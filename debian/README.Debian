dracut for Debian
-----------------

1. Give it a try

Currently dracut is not the default initrd craetion tool in Debian.
You can try dracut without removing initramfs-tools from your machine
by following these steps:

# apt-get --no-install-recommends install dracut-core

cd /boot
cp -p vmlinuz-3.16.0-4-amd64 vmlinuz-3.16.0-4-amd64~dracut
dracut /boot/initrd.img-3.16.0-4-amd64~dracut
lsinitrd /boot/initrd.img-3.16.0-4-amd64~dracut
update-grub

You will get a new grub menu entry, which you can boot then

Select: Advanced options for Debian GNU/Linux
Then: Debian GNU/Linux, with Linux 3.16.0-4-amd64~dracut

The initrd created by initramfs-tools will remain the default boot entry of grub.

If the new initrd works for you, you can switch from initramfs-tools to dracut
by installing the package dracut. This will then replace initramfs-tools.


2. i18n

The module i18n for setting up the keyboard and the font is disabled in
Debian. You cannot use the variables described in modules.d/10i18n/README.

Instead, dracut uses the module 09console-setup which uses setupcon and
is configured in the files /etc/default/keyboard (the keyboard) and
/etc/default/console-setup (the font).  If you prefer to configure by
Debconf, you can use dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration and
dpkg-reconfigure console-setup.
