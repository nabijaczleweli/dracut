Package: dracut

Suggests: dracut-network
Depends: cpio, module-init-tools, udev, ${misc:Depends}
Provides: linux-initramfs-tool
Description: modular, event-driven initramfs infrastructure
 This package contains tools to create a
 bootable initramfs for 2.6 Linux kernels. Unlike existing
 implementations, this is an attempt at having as little as
 possible hard-coded into the initramfs as possible. Therefore,
 instead of scripts hard-coded to do various things, dracut
 contains various modules which contribute functionality to
 udev, which handles device creation. Having the root on MD,
 LVM2, LUKS is supported as well as NFS, iSCSI, NBD and FCOE
 with dracut-network.

Description: modular, event-driven initramfs infrastructure -- network support

 NBD or FCOE.
